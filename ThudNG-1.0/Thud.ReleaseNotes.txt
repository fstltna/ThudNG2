Thud post project release

11/27/2009

I have not been added to the project and that might take some doing.  In the meantime this
is a copy of my changes.

Download Thud.jar and double click it.  You will need JRE 17 or later.

The following has been changed.

1) click the map and the heading of your bot will go in that direction
2) middle mouse click and you will target the mech nearest the click point note
   even if you target it you need to wait for your sensors to lock though
3) mousewheel will zoom
4) if you hit keys 0-9 you will fire that weapon in your status window.
